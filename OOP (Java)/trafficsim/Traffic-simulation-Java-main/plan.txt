TRAFFIC SIMULATION: 11-WEEK OOP MASTERY PROJECT PLAN
================================================================================
Goal: Demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) via a JavaFX Simulation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. THE CORE OOP DEMONSTRATION (The "Big Four")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. ENCAPSULATION:
   - Make all fields (speed, position, color) PRIVATE.
   - Use public getters and setters with validation.
   - Example: setSpeed(double s) should check if s > 0.

B. INHERITANCE:
   - Parent Class: abstract Vehicle
   - Child Classes: Car, Ambulance, Bus.
   - Shared logic (movement) stays in Vehicle; unique logic stays in children.

C. POLYMORPHISM:
   - Use a single List<Vehicle> to store Cars, Ambulances, and Buses.
   - Call vehicle.update() in a loop; each child class reacts differently.
   - Example: Ambulance overrides reactToLight() to ignore Red lights.

D. ABSTRACTION:
   - Use an Interface or Abstract class for 'Entity'.
   - Use Abstract methods for behavior that every vehicle MUST have but 
     implements differently (like 'draw' or 'turn').

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. CLASS HIERARCHY DESIGN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Vehicle (Abstract)
    |-- Car (Inherits from Vehicle)
    |-- Ambulance (Inherits from Vehicle + Overrides behavior)
- TrafficLight (Encapsulated state: Red, Yellow, Green)
- Intersection (Composed of 4 Roads and 4 TrafficLights)
- SimulationEngine (Manages the "World" and the JavaFX AnimationTimer)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. THE 11-WEEK ROADMAP (Simplified for Completion)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WEEKS 1-2: THE MODEL (Logic Only)
   - Create Vehicle, Car, and Light classes. 
   - Test them using System.out.println (No GUI yet).

WEEKS 3-4: BASIC GUI (JavaFX)
   - Setup Stage, Scene, and Canvas. 
   - Draw a static road map. 
   - Draw a simple "Car" as a rectangle that moves.

WEEKS 5-6: INTERACTION LOGIC
   - Connect TrafficLights to the Vehicles.
   - Make the Car stop when the light is RED.

WEEKS 7-8: THE "OOP PROOF" (Variation)
   - Add the Ambulance class. 
   - Program the Ambulance to bypass Red lights.
   - Add buttons to the GUI to "Spawn Car" or "Spawn Ambulance".

WEEKS 9-10: POLISHING & HUD
   - Add a Statistics panel (Total cars passed, current simulation time).
   - Smooth out the movement and fix "teleporting" bugs.

WEEK 11: DOCUMENTATION & DEMO
   - Prepare the report explaining WHERE you used Encapsulation, 
     Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. KEY SUCCESS TIPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Don't overcomplicate turning: Start with a straight road and 1 intersection.
2. Use Enums: For directions (NORTH, SOUTH) and light colors (RED, GREEN).
3. Separation of Concerns: Keep your drawing code (JavaFX) away from your 
   physics code (Math).
